# ESPHome devices

This is a collection and backup of ESPHome devices I run at home.

Some interesting bits and pieces: 

1. I'm using the HLK-LD2450 sensor in multiple parts in my house. For this I use [the excellent code by Lewis' team](https://github.com/EverythingSmartHome/everything-presence-lite/tree/main) over at their GitHub. I'll import this once in a while and apply the updates to all my devices running this same sensor.
2. I recently learned about [packages](https://esphome.io/components/packages.html). This is a pretty neat feature which I'll implement way more often now that I know about it!
3. This repo is merely intended as a backup for me of my devices. Should the SSD where I host my esphome fail I'll have this backup. It might be a bit outdated and it doesn't have my test devices, but at least it will be there.
